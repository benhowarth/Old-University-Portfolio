			For all of my life, I've been interested in creating. I started using computers from very
			early on (from as early as 2) and the possibilities of them fascinated me, I began to create art and animation
			using Adobe Flash from as early as 7. After my transition to secondary school, I began to
			grow curious about making video games, which I have wanted to make since I first played
			Pok√©mon Fire Red on my Gameboy Advance. This curiosity about making video games lead to
			me learning early and simple programming, while that love of video games and fun has stayed,
			I have also gained, over time, an appreciation of code form, useful applications and algorithms and the power
			of data.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm always eager to learn new libraries and tinker with new languages, and I'm always creating.
			<br>
			<br>
			I love collaboration, which filters into my life through Explorer Scouts, my love of comedy and improvisation
			and my integral role in my school's Computer Science/Programming Club. I've always found this to be an important
			part of life, creating and specifically, computer science and software devlopment.
			<br>
			<br>
			Hopefully someday, I will assist in creating some useful application that could, even in a
			small way, affect humanity and the world for the better.
